How to run the application:

1. Install IntelliJ and Java Corretto 17
2. Run the application in IntelliJ with Java Corretto 17 and DeliveryApplication as the main class
3. The endpoints can be accessed through port 8080

Some example requests using curl:

Endpoint to submit order

curl -X POST localhost:8080/orders -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"latitude":12.1, "longitude‚Äù:13.2, "clientId":1}'

Endpoint to Find the Lowest-Cost Delivery Route

curl -X POST localhost:8080/routes/lowest -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"strategy":"haversine", "orderIds":[], "warehouseLatitude":12.1, "warehouseLongitude":13.2}'

Endpoint to Retrieve Route Information

curl localhost:8080/routes/1


Assumptions: 

1. Warehouse address is entered with latitude and longitude.
2. The cost, travel distance, travel time of a route saved in the DB would be calculated using cost, travel distance, travel time of all shipments on that route.


Future considerations/modifications:

1. Use enum for calculation strtegies
2. Validation for timestamps
3. Add more tests/unit tests to cover more cases/edge cases
